Confetti is a comprehensive and customizable confetti view for iOS, built with Swift and UIKit. The set of views allows developers to easily integrate a dynamic confetti effect into their applications, enhancing interactivity and adding a festive mood to the user experience.

## Features
* **Configurable Confetti Direction**: The ConfettiView can emit confetti in different directions including left, right, top, bottom, and both left and right directions.
* **Customizable Emitters**: Specify a list of emitter objects to control the appearance and behavior of the confetti particles.
* **Animation Support**: A default animation is available that applies gravity and birthrate animations to the confetti particles.
* **Predefined Styles**: Five predefined styles: top, left, right, bottom, and leftRight are provided, which use a set of default confetti emitters.

## Notes
While the views in Confetti are easy-to-use, they also offer a high degree of flexibility, catering to most confetti-related use cases. You might wish to extend or adapt them according to your specific requirements.
